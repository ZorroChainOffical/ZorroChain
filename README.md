# 🪙 ZorroChain

**ZorroChain** is a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain project pegged to a **Global Value Index**, combining real-world economic indicators (energy, agriculture, precious metals, compute capacity) with quantum-resistant architecture.

ZorroChain is not just a currency — it's a foundation for a **global economic logic system**, open to all, owned by none, and protected through decentralized infrastructure.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🧠 **Quantum-Resistant Architecture** — built with long-term survivability in mind  
- ⚖️ **Peg Engine** — real-world data feeds define value via global index logic  
- 🗳️ **DAO-Governed** — decentralized control with generational fail-safes  
- 🔐 **Vault-Centric Protocol** — founder access is time-locked, partially sealed  
- 📦 **Modular Rust Core** — all chain functions split into focused core logic  
- 🌐 **Public Chain with Transparent Genesis** — all origins and governance visible  
- 🚧 **Under Construction** — open to contributors, researchers, and observers

## 🔗 Architecture Overview

ZorroChain is built around a modular system of:

- `core/` — minting, peg logic, wallet creation  
- `chain_data/` — genesis and manifest definitions  
- `vault/` — future sealed recovery systems  
- `docs/` — governance and foundational protocols  
- `public/` — web and frontend interface  
- `zorrochain_whitepaper_release/` — cryptographic whitepaper + hash integrity

> Explore the source to see how ZorroChain evolves node-first, server-less, and validator-defined.

## 🚀 Status

**Currently in experimental stage.**  
Whitepaper release is live (with hash), core logic is under audit, and validator/node deployment is **coming soon**.
