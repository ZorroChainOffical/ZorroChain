# Contributing to ZorroChain

Welcome to the ZorroChain open protocol initiative.  
You're not just contributing to code — you're contributing to humanity’s digital backbone.

---

## 🧱 Ground Rules

1. All contributions must follow the protocol’s peg, vault, and governance design.
2. No unilateral monetary changes — submit Peg Proposal to `zorrodao.org`.
3. Forks are allowed, but **public forks must disclose if not DAO-verified.**
4. All proposed modules must include:
   - SHA256 hash in commit
   - `peg_snapshot` if value-affecting
   - Public validation note in `CONTRIB_LOG.md`

---

## 🔐 Verification Flow

- Fork → PR → Pre-DAO review
- Peer validator checks peg logic
- Merged only with 2-of-3 multisig approval by early epoch maintainers (until Epoch 25)

After Epoch 25, ZorroDAO handles integration fully.

## 🤝 Values

- Continuity > Complexity
- Public value > Speculation
- Validation > Hype

Thank you for building the currency of Earth with us.
